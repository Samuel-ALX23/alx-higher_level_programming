#Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

In this task, you will explore two fundamental data structures in Python: sets and dictionaries. Sets are collections of unique elements, while dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.

#Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are immutable, meaning that their elements cannot be changed once they are added. Sets are used to store collections of data where the order of the elements does not matter, and where it is important to ensure that each element appears only once.

#Here are some basic operations on sets:

x in s: Checks whether x is an element of s.
s.add(x): Adds x to s if it is not already there.
s.remove(x): Removes x from s if it is present.
s.union(t): Returns the union of s and t, which is a new set containing all the elements of s and t.
s.intersection(t): Returns the intersection of s and t, which is a new set containing only the elements that are in both s and t.
s.difference(t): Returns the difference of s and t, which is a new set containing the elements that are in s but not in t.

#Dictionaries
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a value, and the keys must be unique. Dictionaries are mutable, meaning that the values associated with keys can be changed. Dictionaries are used to store collections of data where the order of the elements does not matter, and where it is important to be able to access the values by their keys.

#Here are some basic operations on dictionaries:

d[k]: Returns the value associated with key k.
d[k] = v: Sets the value associated with key k to v.
del d[k]: Deletes the key-value pair associated with key k.
d.keys(): Returns a list of all the keys in d.
d.values(): Returns a list of all the values in d.
d.items(): Returns a list of all the key-value pairs in d.

#Tasks
In this task, you will complete a series of exercises to practice using sets and dictionaries. These exercises will cover a variety of concepts, including creating sets and dictionaries, adding and removing elements, and accessing elements using keys.

#Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this task, you will be able to:

Understand the concept of sets and dictionaries in Python
Create and manipulate sets and dictionaries using Python syntax
Utilize sets and dictionaries to solve programming problems
Apply sets and dictionaries to real-world data storage and retrieval scenarios
