0x07. Python - Test-driven development
This repository contains solutions for the tasks in the "0x07. Python - Test-driven development" project of the Holberton School curriculum.

The goal of this project is to learn and practice the concept of Test-driven development (TDD) in Python. The tasks involve writing Python functions and corresponding test cases using the unittest module to verify the correctness of the functions.

Files and Directories
tests/: This directory contains all the test files for the functions implemented in the project.
0-add_integer.py: Python function that adds two integers.
0-add_integer.txt: Text file containing the doctest for the add_integer function.
2-matrix_divided.py: Python function that divides all elements of a matrix by a given divisor.
2-matrix_divided.txt: Text file containing the doctest for the matrix_divided function.
3-say_my_name.py: Python function that prints a person's name.
3-say_my_name.txt: Text file containing the doctest for the say_my_name function.
4-print_square.py: Python function that prints a square using the # character.
4-print_square.txt: Text file containing the doctest for the print_square function.
5-text_indentation.py: Python function that indents a given text.
5-text_indentation.txt: Text file containing the doctest for the text_indentation function.
Getting Started
To get a local copy of the project up and running, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

Navigate to the project directory:
Copy
$ cd your_repository/0x07-python-test_driven_development
You can explore the files and directories or run the test cases using the following command:
Copy
$ python3 -m unittest discover tests
This will run all the test cases and display the results.
