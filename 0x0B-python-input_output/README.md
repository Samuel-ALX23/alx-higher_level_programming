0x0B. Python - Input/Output
This exercise explores the fundamental concepts of reading and writing data in Python. We'll delve into:

Opening and closing files: Learn how to open files for reading, writing, and appending. Discover the open() function and its various modes.
Reading text files: Explore techniques for reading text files line by line, as a whole, and using the with statement for automatic closing.
Writing text files: Master writing to files character by character, line by line, and formatting your output with tools like format() and f-strings.
Binary data and serialization: Understand how to handle binary data like images and convert complex Python objects into a storable format using JSON.
Command-line arguments and user input: Get comfortable with processing arguments passed from the command line and interact with users through prompts and input validation.
Prerequisites
This module assumes basic Python knowledge, including variables, data types, operators, and control flow. Familiarity with file handling concepts would be beneficial but not mandatory.

Objectives
By the end of this exercise, you'll be able to:

Confidently utilize Python's built-in functions for file manipulation.
Read and write text data efficiently, handling different scenarios.
Work with binary data and understand the concept of serialization.
Process user input and interact with scripts from the command line.
Instructions
The exercise is divided into several smaller tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of input/output. Each task will have clear instructions and relevant code snippets to guide you. Feel free to experiment, explore, and ask questions if you get stuck.
