Python: Everything is an Object
This project delves into the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, exploring how everything in Python is fundamentally an object, including variables, data types, and functions. Through a series of exercises and quizzes, you'll gain a deeper understanding of object instantiation, variable aliasing, object identifiers, types, and mutability.

Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

Grasp the core concepts of object-oriented programming in Python
Understand the concept of object instantiation and how to create objects
Comprehend variable aliasing and its implications
Learn about object identifiers and their role in object references
Understand the different data types in Python and their associated operations
Differentiate between mutable and immutable objects
Gain hands-on experience with object-oriented concepts through exercises and quizzes
Prerequisites
Before embarking on this project, it's essential to have a basic understanding of Python programming, including variables, data types, operators, and control flow statements. Familiarity with functions and modules is also recommended.
